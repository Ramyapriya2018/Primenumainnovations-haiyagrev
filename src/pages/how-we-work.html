          <h2>Enquiry to Business Team</h2>
          <p>
            The customer starts an inquiry through the website and/or social
            media platforms with the business team. The business team
            understands the customer, background, field of interest, and
            customer requirements first.

            By clearly giving all the information provided, this inquiry is
            forwarded to the technical team. A customer call is arranged with
            the customer, depending on availability and request. This makes it
            easier to understand customer requirements clearly. There are clear
            clarifications on either side and complete clarity is ensured
            throughout the conversation.

            Depending on your particulars and instructions, the client prepares
            a statement of problem. The document shall be prepared within 7
            days. The document is forwarded for approval to the customer. The
            client approves or makes certain modifications after seeing the SOP.
            The last SOP is complete.

            The final stage is also carried out and forwarded to the customer
            throughout the entire procedure. Upon the client's consent, the
            complete document will be sent to the national/international journal
            for publication. The client is informed when the manuscript is
            accepted.

            The complete document is produced and forwarded to the Client for

          <p>
            Haiyagrev Publications also offers additional services to customers
            after completing all documents, whether it is journal writing or PhD
            writing. We also check the plagiarism content in the paper and
            ensure the content is similar to other published content by less
            than 10 per cent.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also align the work in its entirety, check for grammar errors,
            orthography errors, alignment and intervals of paragraphs, content
            page, subheadings and headings. A complete check is per page, word
            by word 2-3 times to ensure no mistakes are made at all. It is then
            sent for final verification and approval to the Quality control
            manager. The document is sent to the client within the specified
            time when it has been cleared by the Quality Control Manager.
          </p>
          <p>
            If any additional clarifications or small contributions are provided
            in the document only for up to two times.
